(** An OCaml binding to the REST API of Slack. Each function triggers an
    HTTP request, so it returns immediately and returns an {!Lwt.t} value.

    To use the API you first need to either apply for a {!token} from Slack,
    or get one via the OAuth2 API. This string can then be converted into
    a {!session} by means of {!start_session}. With this {!session} most other
    methods from the binding can be called. The result of each API call is
    a variant type containing either the JSON result or an error type
    describing what kind of error occured.

    @author Marek Kubica *)

(** {2 Types used in the binding} *)

(** The binding exposes a number of errors that can happen. As not every
    function returns every possible API error, the possible errors are grouped
    into more convenient sets of errors that can be composed together to get
    the exact error types.

    {e at least} these error variants. *)
type auth_error = [

    timestamps are avoided. *)
